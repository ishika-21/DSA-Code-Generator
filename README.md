DSA-Code-Generator
Developed an application that uses machine learning to generate code snippets based on natural language descriptions provided by the user. The project aimed to create an AI-based solution thatâ€™d help developers reduce the time and effort required to write code for their applications. The GPT-3 prompt was engineered in the backend, ie, the user would just have to write the questions. The tech stack includes Python, OpenAI API (specifically GPT-3), and ReactJS.
